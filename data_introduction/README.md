08/07 - Looked into how to import a file into panda, but wasn't sure where to start the coding process.
import pandas as pd
excel_file_path = C:\Users\ameli\OneDrive\Documents\UNSW\CODE1161\A1
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)
print(df.head(200))
This is the code that I think should be able to import my Excel file to the pandas.

10/07 - Imported data and changed all the information to my own data name and started creating the graphs and charts. I also changed all the titles of the columns and tried to figure out a way to skip the rows to 131 - 251. Names of Y Value (T) means Temporary, (P) means Permanent,

14/07/ - Changed the name of my sheets, and imported multiple sheets of my data into pandas just to get a gist of comparing the data and trying to spot any weird increases or decreases in visa uses.

21/07 - Tried playing around with pandas again. Need to understand each function. Will try to make some maps and histograms tmr.

23/07 - Made more tables using data of other states by copying and pasting the functions and changing what needed to be changed.

04/08 - Realised that my data was only the amount of DEPARTURES. I decided to incorporate the use of the amount of ARRIVALS so that I can compare the data and find the problems that might've caused the data to increase or decrease. Today I successfully made a map of Aus. I also had a play around with the different functions getting assistance from CHATGPT whenever I was unsure of the error meanings.OK so I basically changed things that may have caused A LOT of issues. Argh

07/08: Made some graphs and attempted maps. Graphs were made to demonstrate the different numbers for each state. I decided to

11/08 - Was going to incorporate a Choropleth map, but couldn't. There was always errors involved.

12/08 - Today's goal is to make 2 pie charts. I made 2 piecharts and am on the way to reorganising my data in order for the presentation to go smoothly. I am worried about the length of my presentation because I haven't planned it to 100% yet. I am just happy to be nearly complete and am ready to sleep after this assessment is done. Actually, starting python was so so so tough but now that it's been 12 weeks, I am actually able to kinda understand the different functions and components. THANK GOODNESS. :>
