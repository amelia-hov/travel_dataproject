08/07 - Looked into how to import a file into panda, but wasn't sure where to start the coding process.
import pandas as pd
excel_file_path = C:\Users\ameli\OneDrive\Documents\UNSW\CODE1161\A1
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file_path)
print(df.head(200))
This is the code that I think should be able to import my Excel file to the pandas.
